          >project</a
        >
        can generate random perfect mazes of given dimensions, store them as
        matrices, and show them pictorially. It can solve for typical endpoints
        - start being the top left cell and stop being the bottom right cell -
        or solve for any selected endpoints in the maze which the user feeds
        during runtime by clicking within the maze. It can also allow the user
        to solve it by navigating through the maze with arrow keys. The
        algorithm used to generate the random maze is Recursive Backtracker also
        known as Randomised Depth First Search and the one to solve it is Depth
        First Search (DFS).
